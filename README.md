in this Challenge, I create a simple Work Day Scheduler app. 
This app utilizes dayjs to get the current time.
Users are able to save content inputed to the text area to local storage and load it next time the page initializes via the save button on the right.
time zones are also displayed in different colors based on if the hour of the day has pasted, in the present or in the future.
the current date is also displayed at the top header of the page.# Challenge5
